### Day 3:  29 April 2020

**Today's Progress**: 
- started Complete Web Dev course by Angela Yu
- gotten Andrei's Web Dev Mastery course as well
- web design research

**Thoughts** : lots of cool stuff out there. Trying to get the HTML + CSS basics down. Also, apparently PHP and JQuery are old and obsolete now? Well, Wordpress and others still use them right? I guess I'll keep JQuery light while learning.
Found a few cool/informative peeps on Twitter.

**Hours worked**: 4-5

### Day 5: 1 May 2020

**Today's Progress**: 
- Web Dev Mastery course up to Bootstrap
- advanced CSS
- planned a few projects

**Thoughts** : (today is a national holiday - less time to work on coding). Learned quite a few snippets of stuff for CSS and general practices. Also started Andrei Neagoie's Complete Web Dev in 2020: Zero to Master course. Stopped right in the middle of Bootstrap, so now I'm level with Angela's. Planned a few ideas and also prepped a general course of action for the month of May.

**Hours worked**: 4

*************************************
### Day 6: 2 May 2020

**Today's Progress**: 
- usual Twitter bookmarking of interesting/useful stuff
- Bootstrap & more on Andrei's course
- played around with CSS + webpages
- should note that I've been obviously playing around with VSCode and Github and Github Pages during these weeks.

**Thoughts** : flex and grid still need to work out the kinks - like where exactly to specify alignment/centering etc. Good work on getting a "website" up on Github + Mailchimp landing page.

**Hours worked**: 4
